* `3a.dd`: 	Three somewhat uncorrelated sequences. I meant for s0 and s1 to be correlated, but they actually are not. 
  Excel says the correlations should be:
  ```s0	s1	-0,159483023
  s0	s2	-0,233120125
  s1	s2	-0,248545745
  ```
* `3b.dd`: Two perfectly correlated sequences and one uncorrelated. We have s0 and s1 that should get correlation 1.0 
  and s2 should be uncorrelated with the others.
